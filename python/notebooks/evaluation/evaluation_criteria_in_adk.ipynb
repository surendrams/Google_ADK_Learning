    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Development Kit [(ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) is a flexible and modular framework that applies software development principles to AI agent creation. It is designed to simplify building, deploying, and orchestrating agent workflows, from simple tasks to complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional software with clear pass/fail unit tests, LLM agents, due to their probabilistic nature, require a more nuanced evaluation/testing approach. ADK helps you manage this probablistic behavior and enables you to [evaluate/test](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/) Agents not only for their final output, but also the path they took to achieve that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This Colab notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate/test your Agents using various criteria using CLI. It covers following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   `tool_trajectory_avg_score`: Compares agent's tool calls with expected trajectory.\n",
    "  *   `response_match_score`: Evaluates final response similarity using Rouge-1.\n",
    "  *   `final_response_match_v2`: Assesses semantic equivalence of responses using an LLM judge.\n",
    "  *   `rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1`: Evaluates response quality against user-defined rubrics with an LLM judge.\n",
    "  *   `rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1`: Assesses tool usage quality against user-defined rubrics with an LLM judge.\n",
    "  *   `hallucinations_v1`: Checks for false, contradictory, or unsupported claims in agent responses.\n",
    "  *   `safety_v1`: Evaluates the harmlessness of agent responses using Vertex AI General AI Eval SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand how to set up and run comprehensive evaluations for your ADK Agents."

    "\n",
    "For each invocation that is being evaluated, this criterion compares the list of\n",
    "tool calls produced by the agent against the list of expected tool calls. The\n",
    "comparison is done by performing an exact match on the tool name and tool\n",
    "arguments for each tool call in the list. If all tool calls in an invocation\n",
    "match exactly in content and order, a score of 1.0 is awarded for that\n",

    "scores across all invocations in the eval case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output And How To Interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a perfect match\n",
    "between actual and expected tool trajectories for all invocations, and 0.0\n",
    "indicates a complete mismatch for all invocations. Higher scores are better. A\n",
    "score below 1.0 means that for at least one invocation, the agent's tool call\n",
    "trajectory deviated from the expected one.\n",

The `hallucinations_v1` criterion assesses whether the model's response contains any false, contradictory, or unsupported claims based on the provided context. The detailed invocation results show that for all turns in the conversation, the agent's responses were fully grounded in the context, resulting in a score of 1.0 for each invocation. This demonstrates that the agent's responses are free from hallucinations."
