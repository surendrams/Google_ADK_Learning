    "*   **Buyout Trap Warning (PEN):** Penumbra Inc. (PEN) is flagged as a **Buyout Trap**. While the 12% gain is impressive, it is the result of a definitive acquisition agreement by Boston Scientific (BSX) at a valuation of ~$374/share. With the stock currently trading near $352 and the RSI overbought (74.2), the upside is capped. New investors should avoid \"chasing\" as the risk-to-reward ratio for a merger arbitrage play is thin.\n",
    "*   **The Semiconductor Surge:** The bottom half of the list (**ENTG, TTMI, MKSI, ONTO, KLAC**) represents a \"Quality Cluster.\" These firms are major players in the semiconductor supply chain. With RSIs ranging from 59 to 64, they are in a healthy momentum zone—strong buying pressure without being dangerously overextended.\n",
    "*   **Accretive Growth (TLN):** Talen Energy's gain is backed by a major asset acquisition rather than being a target itself. This suggests long-term fundamental strength rather than a temporary price spike.\n",
    "*   **Momentum Leader (STUB):** StubHub (STUB) shows the strongest percentage gain without buyout news. However, with an RSI approaching 70, a brief consolidation period is expected before further entry is advised."

    "### **Market Summary & Analysis**\n",
    "*   **Sector Dominance:** Space Technology (**ASTS**, **LUNR**, **RKLB**) and AI Infrastructure (**SMCI**, **IREN**) are the primary drivers for today’s market momentum. The semiconductor sector is buoyed by **Taiwan Semiconductor's (TSM)** positive 2026 outlook.\n",
    "*   **Overbought Alerts:** **IBRX**, **FIGR**, and **SMCI** are currently trading at extreme RSI levels (above 70). While the momentum is strong, the \"Wait for Pullback\" strategy is recommended to avoid entering at a localized peak.\n",
    "*   **Quality Pick:** **AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)** continues to show high-quality growth with a market cap exceeding $30B, supported by a new U.S. missile defense contract rather than speculative rumors.\n",
    "*   **Trap Warning:** **Fly Leasing (FLY)** shows signs of consolidation-driven gains. Investors should exercise caution as these gains are often volatile and sensitive to acquisition timeline shifts (Buyout Trap potential).\n",
